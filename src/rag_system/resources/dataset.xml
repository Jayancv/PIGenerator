		<Title>Nitrogen Liquefaction using Linde Cycle</Title>
		<Description>A process for gas liquefaction, particularly nitrogen liquefaction, which combines the use of a
nitrogen auto-refrigeration cooling cycle with one or more closed-loop refrigeration cycles using
two or more refrigerant components. The closed-loop refrigeration cycle provide refrigeration
in a temperature range having a lowest temperature between about -125F. and about -250F.
A nitrogen expander cycle provides additional refrigeration, a portion of which is provided
at temperatures below the lowest temperature of the closed-loop or recirculating refrigeration
cycle or cycles. The lowest temperature of the nitrogen expander cycle refrigeration range is
between about -220F. and about -320F. The combined use of the two dierent refrigerant
systems allows each system to operate most eciently in the optimum temperature range,
thereby reducing the power consumption required for liquefaction.
Gaseous nitrogen at 80F, 1 atm is compressed to 25 atm pressure. Adiabatic compressor is
employed for this purpose with 50% eciency which also results in increasing the temperature
of N2 stream to 1577F. The stream is further cooled to -306F with the help of a series of
cooler and heat exchanger. Cooled N2 is further expanded by reducing the pressure to 1 atm
using an isenthalpic valve to obtain liqueed N2.

		<Title>Hydrogen Production through Methane Catalytic Steam Reforming</Title>
		<Description>Natural gas has been proposed as a source of hydrogen for fuel cell vehicle applications because
of the existing infrastructure. In a process known as steam reforming, natural gas and steam are
reacted into mostly carbon monoxide and hydrogen with some carbon dioxide also produced.
There can also be excess water in the reformate stream.
A feed consisting of 10000 mol/h CH4, 10000 mol/h H2O, and 100 mol/h H2 enters into
a steam reforming reactor that operates at 1000 K and a 1 atm feed pressure. The reactions
taking place in the PFR are as follows:
The steam reforming reaction is given as:
CH4 + H2O *)
3H2 + CO
In the steam reformer, the water gas shift reaction also takes place as: CO+H2O *)
H2+CO2
Adding together the steam reforming and water gas shift reactions gives the overall reaction:
CH4 + 2H2O *)
4H2 + CO2
In the reactor, methane (CH4) and water (H2O) are fed as reactants and carbon dioxide
(CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen (H2) are produced over a nickel catalyst on an
alumina support. The weight of the catalyst is 386 g. The reaction takes place in isothermal
mode with reactor volume of 1 m3. 75.62% conversion is obtained for methane.		</Description>

		<Title>Solid Carbon Combustion</Title>
		<Description>Combustion, or burning, is a high-temperature exothermic redox chemical reaction between a fuel (the reduc-
tant) and an oxidant, usually atmospheric oxygen, that produces oxidized, often gaseous products, in a mixture
termed as smoke. Combustion in a re produces a
ame, and the heat produced can make combustion self-
sustaining. Combustion is often a complicated sequence of elementary radical reactions. Solid fuels, such as
wood and coal, rst undergo endothermic pyrolysis to produce gaseous fuels whose combustion then supplies
the heat required to produce more of them. Combustion is often hot enough that incandescent light in the form
of either glowing or a
ame is produced. In this process, solid carbon mixed with air at 298.15 K and 101325
Pa is sent to a conversion reactor. Reaction takes place between carbon and oxygen to form carbon dioxide
where 100% conversion is considered for carbon.		</Description>

		<Title>Production of Natural Gas</Title>
		<Description>
Introduction
This aim of this project was to convert existing literature into a steady state simulation of Syngas production using
liquefied natural gas (R-LNG) as a raw material. The simulation uses the provided data of mass flow rates,
temperature and pressure obtained from Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore Ltd (FACT), ammonia plant.
The novelty of using R-LNG is that it has a lower carbon/hydrogen ratio, resulting in a total reduction of
steam: carbon ratio and subsequently reduces CO2 emissions and thus reduces the carbon footprint of the process.
Ammonia is produced from a gaseous mixture comprising of mainly N2 and H2 in a 1:3 ratio. Conventionally ammonia plants
use naphtha as a feedstock for syngas production serving as a source for H2 while the N2 is obtained from the air.
Using naphtha as a feed generates high amount of CO2 due to higher carbon to hydrogen ratio. FACT wishes to upgrade its
plant by introducing syngas production using R-LNG. This paper provides a simulation for the same.
Process Description
The ammonia production mainly consists of two steps:
(1) Syngas Production
(2) Ammonia Synthesis
Part I will only be focused in this flow sheet. The unit operations included are steam reforming (primary reforming),
air reforming (secondary reforming), CO shift reaction, CO2 removal and finally methanation. In the primary reformer,
hydrocarbon reforming takes place in the presence of steam. This reaction is controlled to maintain 10.5% of
hydrocarbon in the output stream that is necessary to perform complete air reforming in secondary reformer.
In secondary reformer, the nitrogen for ammonia synthesis is produced by air reforming. Here heat is supplied
by combustion. Burning gas provides heat for the rest of the reforming process.
After the reforming section, the output stream contains H2, N2, CO, CO2 and along with minute presence of unreacted
hydrocarbons. Removal of carbon oxides is carried out using shift convertors and CO2 absorber.
In the CO shift conversion, the CO acts as reducing agent for water to yield H2 and CO2. Methanation
is the simplest procedure to remove traces of carbon oxides from a stream. So using the above mentioned method,
the concentration of carbon oxides is reduced.
Syngas production or feed preparation for ammonia synthesis has been modeled using three conversion reactors and two
equilibrium reactors. In this particular work, desulphurized R-LNG acts as a hydrogen source. When this R-LNG is
reacted with steam, it gets reformed in a primary reformer which is a conversion reactor. Air is added to the second
conversion reactor (secondary reformer) to obtain the nitrogen. Shift conversion reactions take place in next
two equilibrium reactors. It is followed by CO2 absorption, for the removal of CO2 from the feed. Later a methanator unit,
which is a conversion reactor, is used to remove traces of carbon oxides from the stream.

Reactions
The following reactions take place in their respective reactors:
Primary reforming
(a) CH4 + H2O -> CO + 3H2 (Conversion reaction)
(b) CH4 + 2H2O ->CO2 + 4H2 (Conversion reaction)
(c) CO + H2O -> CO2 + H2 (Equilibrium)
Secondary reforming
(a) CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O (Conversion reaction)
(b) CH4 + 1.5O2 -> CO + 2H2O (Conversion reaction)
Shift conversion
(a) CO + H2O -> CO2 + H2 (Equilibrium reaction)
Methanation
(a) CO + 3H2 -> CH4 + H2O (Conversion reaction)
(b) CO2 + 3H2 -> CH4 + 2H2O (Conversion reaction)</Description>

		<Title>Air-Benzene Separation using compression</Title>
		<Description>
Background: Emission of volatile organic compounds from processes is closely
regulated. Both the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) have established regulations and
standards covering emissions and frequency of exposure. This problem concerns
the first step of the removal of benzene vapor from an exhaust stream, designed
to recover 95% of the benzene from air by compression. The exit pressure needs
to be calculated using Raoult’s Law.
Description of the flowsheet: In this example air-benzene mixture containing
0.982 mole fraction of air, at 26 degree Celsius and 1 atm pressure is sent at the
rate of 1kg/s(feed) to an adiabatic compressor the increase in pressure is 142
atm this is calculated using Raoult’s Law. Next the compressed mixture is sent to a
cooler to bring its temperature down to 26 degree Celsius. This brings about
condensation of benzene vapors, air is essentially non-condensable. The adiabatic
compressor and cooler, together act as an isothermal compressor. Next the
Vapor-Liquid mixture is sent to a flash separator to separate liquid benzene
from
the vapor. Purified air is sent to a valve which reduces its pressure from 143 atm
to 1 atm. This air can be further purified or let out depending on the safety
standards.
Results:
1) Purified air at 26 degree Celsius and 1atm contains benzene in the
mole fraction of 0.000904 which is very close to the desired value of 0.000916.
2) The liquid from the flash separator contains 95% of the initial benzene
and very small mole fraction(0.001645) of air.
3) The energy required for the various components of the flowsheet can be
readily calculated using DWSIM and the total energy required for the process is
equal to 751.833KW.
Conclusion:
1) Though air is essentially non-condensable a very small mole
fraction of air does get condensed.
2) The amount of benzene separated from air can be increased by increasing the
pressure in the compressor.
3) Adiabatic compressor and the cooler together act as an isothermal compressor
which results in the condensation of the benzene vapors.		</Description>

		<Description>
Background:
A steam turbine is a device that extracts thermal energy from pressurized
steam and uses it to do mechanical work on a rotating output shaft. Its
modern manifestation was invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884.
Because the turbine generates rotary motion, it is particularly suited to be
used to drive an electrical generator.
The steam turbine is a form of heat engine that derives much of its
improvement in thermodynamic efficiency from the use of multiple stages in
the expansion of the steam, which results in a closer approach to the ideal
reversible expansion process.
Description of the flowsheet:
Water at 65 degree Fahrenheit, 14.7 psi and a mass flow rate of 2000 pound
mass /hour is sent into a pump to increase its pressure to 250 psi. This water at
high pressure is heated to its boiling point using a boiler (401 degree Fahrenheit).
This vapor is now super-heated in a heater to 550 degree Fahrenheit to ensure
that condensation of the steam doesn’t occur in the adiabatic expander. This
superheated vapor is sent to a turbine in which steam expands adiabatically and
rotates the shaft which is connected to an electromagnet to produce electricity.
The spent steam is sometimes recycled to be reused.
Results:
1) Energy produced in the steam turbine is 101.31988KW
2) Energy required to raise the temperature of water to its boiling point
is 684.342KW
2) Energy required to superheat the steam is 52.743 KW.
Conclusion:
1) Steam turbines usually operate at efficiencies around 30-40%.
2) Energy produced is almost 1/7 of total energy given to steam,
hence steam should be recycled to save energy.		</Description>

		<Title>Closed Loop Steam Turbine</Title>
		<Description>
Background:
A thermal power station converts heat energy to electrical energy. In thermal power plants closed loop steam driven turbines are extensively used. Water is heated, turns into steam and spins a steam turbine which drives an electrical generator. After it passes through the turbine, the steam is condensed in a condenser and recycled to where it was heated initially. This is known as a Rankine cycle. The greatest variation in the design of thermal power stations is due to the different heat sources, fossil fuel dominates here, although nuclear heat energy and solar heat energy are also used. In addition to generating electrical power, thermal power plants are also designed to produce heat energy for industrial purposes of district heating, or desalination of water.
Description of flowsheet:
Steam at 8kg/s enters the adiabatic turbine at 500 degree Celsius and 10000kPa pressure and runs the turbine. The turbine operates at 75% efficiency and generates about 19858kW of power output. The expanded steam exits the turbine at 60 degree Celsius and 20kPa pressure. This steam is further cooled to 40 degree Celsius where 6684kW of energy is extracted. Now the steam has condensed to water and is recycled again. This water output from the cooler is pumped to a boiler with an increase in pressure back to it feed pressure of 10000kPa. The pump used has 75% efficiency. Now the water which enters the boiler at elevated pressure is again heated up to 500 degree Celsius to get back the initial steam feed conditions. The energy input for the heater is 26441kW which is used up to boil it to the feed conditions. Now this steam output from the boiler is fed to the adiabatic turbine to complete the closed cycle steam turbine system.
Results:
The following results are readily calculated by DWSIM
1) 26441kW of energy input is required for the boiler.
2) The pump requires 101kW of energy input.
3) The total energy input is 26542kW.
4) The energy output from the adiabatic turbine is 19858kW and from the cooler is 6684kW.
5) The total energy output is then 26542kW.
Conclusions:
1) The required energy input to boil the water and get required steam is obtained by combustion of fossil fuels or other various methods is effectively converted to shaft work which is converted to electrical energy.
2) The cooler used can be a heat exchanger where the output energy calculated will be used to heat the inlet cooling fluid into the exchanger.

		<Title>VAPOR COMPRESSION REFRIGERATION CYCLE</Title>
		<Description>
Background: Vapor Compression Refrigeration system is one in which the
refrigerant undergoes phase changes, is one of the many refrigeration cycles and
it is widely used method for air conditioning and in automobiles. It is also used in
domestic and commercial refrigerators, large-scale warehouses for chilled or
frozen storage of foods and meats, refrigerated trucks and railroad cars, and host
of other commercial and industrial services. Oil refineries, petrochemical and
chemical processing plants and natural gas processing plants are among the many
industrial plants that often utilize large vapor-compression refrigeration systems.
In very basic terms, refrigeration systems are used to remove heat from one area
and transfer it into another area.
Description of the flow-sheet: The vapor compression system simulated here
uses propane as the liquid refrigerant medium because of its favorable properties.
Circulating refrigerant enters the adiabatic compressor in the thermodynamic
state known as saturated vapor, the compressor increases it pressure and
temperature and propane leaves the compressor in the super-heated vapor state.
This super-heated vapor now enters the condenser which converts it to a
saturated liquid at the same pressure. Now this saturated liquid is at a high
pressure hence it is throttled with the help of a valve and a vapor-liquid mixture
at atmospheric pressure is sent to an evaporator which converts the mixture to
saturated vapor and the outlet stream from the evaporator is recycled and sent
as the input to the adiabatic compressor.
RESULTS:
1) Saturated propane vapor enters the compressor at a temperature of 230K
which is desired temperature for the refrigeration of certain products and 1 atm.
2) Propane leaves the compressor at 298K which is around the ambient
temperature.
3) Energy spent on various operations is as follows
i) Evaporator energy: 232.749 KW
ii) Condenser energy: 348.2409 KW
iii) Compressor energy: 115.491 KW

		<Title>CARNOT ENGINE</Title>
		<Description>
Background: A Carnot engine is an engine which operates on the reversible
Carnot cycle. The basic model for this was developed by Nicolas Sadi Carnot in
1824. A heat engine acts by transferring energy from a warm region to a cool
region of space and in that process, converting some of that energy to mechanical
work. The cycle may also be reversed. The system maybe worked upon by an
external force and in the process, it can transfer energy from a cooler system to a
warmer one, thereby acting as a refrigerator or heat pump rather than a heat
engine.
Carnot’s theorem:
No engine operating between two heat reservoirs can be more efficient than a
Carnot engine operating between the same reservoirs.
W is the work-done by the system
QH is the energy put into the system
Tc is the absolute temperature of the cold reservoir
TH is the absolute temperature of the hot reservoir
Description of the flow-sheet:
Gas at high temperature (in this case Helium at 600K) absorbs heat from heat
reservoir reversibly and hence undergoes an
isothermic expansion this is modeled with the help of a valve (also called the
isothermal expander). Now the outlet from this is sent to an adiabatic
expander
where the gas undergoes an expansion and hence a decrease in its temperature
till it reaches the temperature of the cold reservoir . The gas now rejects heat
isothermally into the cold reservoir reversibly and this can be modeled as an
isothermal compression using a valve (also called the isothermal
compressor).
Now the gas is sent into an adiabatic compressor where its temperature and
pressure are increased until its properties are identical with that of the inlet
stream this is accomplished using the recycle block.
Results:
1) Temperature of gas before and after isothermal expansion is 600 K
2) Entropy change of gas after isothermal expansion = (7.755234-
6.288268) = 1.466966 KJ/Kg.K. Therefore heat energy absorbed = 1.466966*600 =
880.1796 KJ/kg.
3) Temperature of gas before and after isothermal compression is
475.023 K
4) Entropy change of gas after isothermal compression = (6.288268-
7.755234) = -1.466966 KJ/Kg.K Therefore heat energy absorbed =
-1.466966*475.023 = -696.8425 KJ/Kg.
5) Total heat energy absorbed = (880.1796-696.8425) = 183.3368 KJ/Kg.
6) Hence efficiency is equal to (183.3368/880.1796) = 0.20829 or 20.83%.
7) Efficiency from Carnot’s formula is equal to 1-(475.023/600) =
0.208295 or 20.83%. Hence the results match.
8) Total work done by adiabatic compressor and adiabatic expander are
equal to 648.9549 KW.

		<Title>A Simple De-Humidification System</Title>
		<Description>
Background:
The process in which the moisture or water vapour or the humidity is removed
from the air keeping its dry bulb (DB) temperature constant is called as the
dehumidification process. This process is represented by a straight vertical line
on the psychrometric chart starting from the initial value of relative humidity,
extending downwards and ending at the final value of the relative humidity. Like
the pure humidification process, in actual practice the pure dehumidification
process is not possible, since the dehumidification is always accompanied by
cooling or heating of the air. Dehumidification process along with cooling or
heating is used in number of air conditioning applications.
Relative humidity in dwellings should preferably range from 30 to 50%.
Dehumidifiers reduce humidity levels, making a room less hospitable to
allergens such as dust mites, mold, and mildew.
Dehumidifiers are used in industrial climatic chambers, to reduce relative
humidity and the dew point in many industrial applications from waste and fresh
water treatment plants to indoor grow rooms where the control of moisture is
essential.
Description of flowsheet:
The feed enters at a flowrate of 3600kg/h and a relative humidity of 68% at
100kPa pressure and 20 degree Celsius temperature. This feed air enters the
compressor which increases the pressure to 275kPa. Now the compressed air is
cooled to 20 degree Celsius temperature using a cooler. This cooled air is passed
on to a gas liquid separator where the condensed water can be separated. The
gas-liquid separator separates the condensed liquid which is at a flowrate of
16.85kg/h. The top product of the gas-liquid separator is depressurised to
100kPa using a valve. The product obtained from the valve is the dehumidified
air which is having a relative humidity of 36.3%.
Results:
1) Dehumidified air is obtained at 36.3% relative humidity.
2) The compressor requires 62.781kW of energy
3) The cooler gives out 74.263kW of energy.
Conclusions:
1) This process gives a net output of 11.482kW energy which can be used for
other processes.
2) The more we compress the inlet air, higher amount of water is condensed
which gives higher degree of dehumidification.

		<Title>Benzene Toluene Fractionation Unit</Title>
		<Description>
Background:
Benzene Toluene Fractionation to produce pure benzene via Benzene Distillation during the past decade, multivariable controllers for have been extensively applied in ethylene plants. These control applications have increased process efficiency and plant capacity.
By now, the technology is well understood and widely accepted. The only obstacle to further implementation and better maintenance is the cost and the majority of the cost lies in the model identification step.
The Benzene/Toluene fractionator is part of an aromatics extraction unit. The aromatics are extracted from an aromatics rich stream using liquid/liquid extraction. The benzene is separated from the aromatic extract in a distillation column. The light and heavy key components are benzene and toluene, respectively. The relative volatility for these compounds is approximately 2.5, making this a separation with a moderate reflux to feed ratio required. This means that incremental benefits of better control are moderate and justifying a major control project for such an application can be a challenge. But, the benefits of better control are not insignificant, especially with the high cost of energy, in recent years.
Description of flowsheet:
The equimolar mixture of benzene and toluene feed enters at 100kmol/h at 25 degree Celsius in to a preheater heat exchanger where it is heated up to 40.32 degree Celsius by the bottoms of the distillation column. The preheated feed then enters the 11th stage of the 24 staged distillation column which is operating with 1 atm condenser and boiler pressure at a reflux ratio of 10. The distillate obtained has 0.91 mole fraction of benzene at 55kmol/h and the bottoms is obtained at 45kmol/h at 110.4 degree Celsius temperature which is recycled to a heat exchanger and used to preheat the feed. The distillate is hence purified benzene which is obtained at 82 degree Celsius is the final product. The cooled bottoms at 83 degree Celsius is highly pure toluene with a mole fraction of 0.999 which is also of high importance to the industry. The Roult’s Law property package is used in the flowsheet.
Results:
1) Distillate obtained is benzene with mole fraction of 0.91.
2) The bottoms is highly pure toluene with mole fraction of 0.999.
3) The total power requirement for the process is 255kW which is readily calculated by DWSIM.
4) The condenser duty is 5259kW and the reboiler duty is -5514kW.
5) The feed is preheated from 25 degree Celsius to 40 degree Celsius by the bottoms which in turn cools from 110 degree Celsius to 83 degree Celsius.
Conclusions:
1) The distillate concentration can be varied by varying the reflux ratio in the distillation column. By increasing the reflux ratio, higher purity of benzene can be obtained.
2) The bottoms is at 110 degree Celsius and hence this heat can be effectively used to preheat the feed or elsewhere.

		<Title>HETEROGENEOUS AZEOTROPIC DISTILLATION OF BUTANOL AND WATER</Title>
		<Description>
Background:
The recent surge in crude-oil prices and issues of energy independence and carbon
dioxide emissions have generated new interest in bio fuels. Ethanol is now being produced on a fairly
large scale for blending into gasoline. Qurishi et al discuss the advantages of n-butanol over ethanol:
lower heat of vaporization, lower vapour pressure, higher octane number, and higher energy
density.
Some opportunities that can change the dynamics of the n-butanol industry in the years to
come include the demand supply-gap in China(being a major importer),
 rising investments in Saudi Arabia's oil and gas downstream sector, and increasing demand of biobased butanol.
 However, the concentration of nbutanol produced in the batch fermenter is quite low (20 g/L) because of toxicity problems.
In addition,acetone and ethanol are also produced, which must be removed from the mixture coming from the fermenter.
Traditional Bio based processes produce n-butanol amongst the other isomers. Butanol forms an azeotrope
with water at 0.5 atm,780C with compositions around 77.85% water, 22.15% n-butanol . Breaking the
azeotrope ; with the vapour from two absorbers coupled with a decanter forms the basis for the separation. The
flow sheeting source is
DESCRIPTION :
Feed at 780C is admitted to a re-boiled absorber at an intermediate stage of a 10 stage column. The
aqueous liquid from the decanter(Recycle to the 1st column) at 700C is fed to the top stage. A small fraction
of vapour in the feed, at a higher temperature and the liquid undergo a flash at each stage. The feed
composition of 0.98 water,0.02 butanol on the right extreme of azeotropic composition; ensures the fraction of
water in vapour is reduced(as evident from the T-X-Y diagram above) leaving the over-head product richer in
butanol as compared to that in feed.
The organic phase from the decanter(also a recycle) is fed to a 10 stage re-boiled absorber. The
composition of over-head vapour almost near to the azeotrope. The vapours from the 2 columns are fed to a
mixer which in turn is cooled to 700C , to bring it to a liquid-liquid phase.(as seen in T-X-Y Diagram).
Now, the liquid is fed to a decanter(with appropriate models defined for Liquid-Liquid Separation) where the
aqueous and organic phases are separated , which in turn are used as reflux for the respective columns.

Conclusions and Recommendations :
1. The process is highly sensitive to change of property methods during simulation. Methods such as
UNIQUAC, MODIFIED UNIFAC(DORTMUND),NRTL support VLLE for flash calculations.
2. Generate a phase diagram while using a given property method. For the T-X-Y drawn above, the NRTL
method won't give desired results for the given system. 98% feed water in NRTL model is usually a region,
not outside the LLE; while one expects to be outside.
3. The Re-boiled absorber unit operation in DWSIM usually takes longer time to converge. One has to know
how to set the tolerance limits if the basis is on mole fraction of the bottom. For simulation of sensitive
azeotropic mixtures, a CAPE OPEN plugin model is used. The Prausnitz interaction parameters for this
system is loaded from ChemSep. Make sure to install ChemSep to simulate and view detailed results.
4. The reboiler load for 10 or 20 stages is not so much significant. 10 stages are usually taken to reduce capital
costs. A new DWSIM plugin to evaluate process costs is also available
5. Process takes place at 0.5 atmosphere, which decreases boiling points of the respective components(Refer
T-X-Y diagram) so that cooling water can be used in a cooler for a desired temperature reduction.
6. Extensive Temperature Control on the top plate of the column, rigorous decanter modelling to include
settling time has to be done for dynamic control of the system. Disturbances in feed is a major factor.
7. The feed is introduced at an intermediate stage if the butanol composition is below 2%. The configuration is
different for higher mole %. It is directly fed to decanter in such cases.

		<Title>REFINERY LIGHT ENDS SEPARATION</Title>
		<Description>
BACKGROUND:
The large amount of carbon dioxide in the natural gas from the well dictates the use of
an extractive distillation system to separate the ethane from the carbon dioxide because of an azeotrope.
The bottoms from the ethane recovery column is called natural gas liquid (NGL) and is fed to three
distillation columns operating in series. The feed is a mixture of Ethane(C2) , Propane (C3), Iso-butane
(iC4), n-butane (nC4), iso-pentane (iC5), and n-pentane (nC5). Propane, Butane, Iso-butane are removed
successively in a high pressure 3 stage distillation columns.
PROCESS DESCRIPTION :
The first column is a De-Propanizer. The separation of Propane from the butane isomer
mixture is a bit difficult. The column has 50 stages with Condenser Pressure at 17 atm. The top and
bottom pressure is 17.1 and 17.5 atm respectively. High pressure in the condenser allows usage of
cooling water for temperature reduction. Feed enters at 17.4 atm to the 18th Stage.
Design specifications for this column are 0.01% Iso butane ,all ethane in distillate ; 0.1mol% propane in
bottoms.
The second column is a De-Butanizer. Its function is to take the iC4 and nC4
components overhead for subsequent separation in the downstream column. The separation in the
debutanizer is between the nC4 and the iC5, which is fairly easy with a relative volatility of 2.2 at 322 K.
A column with 31 stages is used, operating at 7.1 atm with feed reduced to a pressure of 7.3 atm to stage
16.
The design specifications are 0.2 mol % iC5 in the distillate and 0.2 mol % nC4 in the bottoms.
The third column is a De-IsoButanizer. Separation between iC4 and nC4 is relatively
difficult, so a 80 stage column is used. It operates at 6.6 atm with feed admitted to stage 39.
he design specifications are 2 mol % nC4 in the distillate and 2 mol % iC4 in the bottoms.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Because the iC4/nC4 separation is quite difficult (1.3 relative volatility at 322 K), this separation is to
be performed when the mixture is essentially binary so as to minimize energy requirements. So, the De-
Butanizer is followed by De-IsoButanizer.
2. The feed stage and the corresponding Reboiler Duty can be played around to achieve the minimum
heat load which reduces operating costs.
3. The process is sensitive to thermodynamic parameters defined. A very small fraction of vapours do
appear that are specific to the models defined.
4. The bottom product from De-Propanizer is sent to through a pressure varying value to the inlet of De-
Butanizer. The out -let pressure of the valve at over-head of column 2 is modified, to bring the entire

		<Title>EXTRACTIVE DISTILLATION OF METHYLAL/METHANOL USING DIMETHYL FORMAMIDE</Title>
		<Description>
INTRODUCTION:
Methylal, also called dimethoxymethane, is an important intermediate that is widely used in
many fields for its exceptional dissolving ability, extremely low viscosity, amphiphilic characteristics, low
surface tension and particularly high evaporation rate. A high purity of methylal is needed when it is used
for making perfume,pharmaceuticals or as a molecular weight modifier for polyacetal resin. Unfortunately,
methylal and methanol forms a minimum-boiling azeotrope at atmosphere pressure with 94.06 wt %
methylal. Thus a methylal-methanol mixture cannot be separated completely through a simple distillation
process.
Purification of methylal by a membrane process involves degradations and weak permeating
flows which makes it harder to consider an industrial development by using organic membranes. Extractive
distillation can be an alternative. It involves adding a third substance(entrainer/solvent) that can alter the
molecular properties of the two compounds of interest. Since, it has different affinities to the key
components, addition of the entrainer causes an increase in the relative volatility of the light and heavy key
components. It is generally preferred when the relative volatility of key component is 1.1 and a small
amount of entrainer is added to the products separated which is inevitable. A make-up stream is added to
account for the solvent losses.
PROCESS:
The mixture "Methylal/Methanol/Water" is fed to the 42nd stage of 52 staged extractive
distillation column with the solvent DMF(Di-Methyl Form amide) fed to the 4th stage. The presence of
entrainer alters the relative volatility between the two, causing pure Methylal to move towards the top and
mixture toward the bottom of the column.
The mixture is fed into the 9th stage of a 22 stage recovery column to produce almost pure
Methanol at the top and almost pure solvent at the bottom. It is recycled back to the extractive distillation
column and merged with one additional pure make-up stream to account for the solvent losses.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. The system is sensitive to thermodynamic models and interaction parameters loaded.
2. Because entrainer is a dominant factor in the feasibility and economy of extractive distillation, several
rules for entrainer selection have been proposed. More recently, computer aided molecular design of
entrainer for extractive distillation based on a genetic algorithm has been presented. It facilitates the choice
of extractive agent through a computer program.
3. For the separation of a methylal/methanol mixture by using extractive distillation, various entrainers
have been recommended such as water, aqueous alkaline solutions, ethylene glycol(EG),paraformaldehyde
and dimethylformamide (DMF). DMF introduces no further azeotrope in the system and shows a higher
relative volatility (1.833), it is chosen as the most suitable entrainer. This large relative volatility allows an
economical separation sequence.
4. Residue curve - composition trajectory of the residue liquid in the still during open equilibrium
evaporation.
Residue curve map - diagram that shows residue curves for different initial still compositions for a given
mixture in the composition space.
Saddle - singular point with finitely many paths both approaching and departing.
The RCM of the methylal-methanol-DMF ternary system mapped by Chem-Sep using UNIQUAC the model
is shown in Figure.It can be seen that the methylal-methanol azeotrope is the unstable node, DMF is the
stable node, and both methylal and methanol are the saddles. The resulting residue curves with arrows point
to pure DMF. It can be seen that no distillation boundary exists.This is an ideal situation for selection of an
extractive distillation process.
5. It is known that for the extractive distillation process, an increase in the entrainer flow rate will reduce the
heat duty of the extractive distillation column,but the heat duty of the entrainer recovery column will
increase, and a larger column diameter is expected. Thus, a trade-off between the extractive distillation
column costs(include both the fixed capital costs and operating costs) and entrainer recovery column costs
needs to be made. So there exists an optimal entrainer flow rate that minimizes TAC for fixed theoretical
plates. Qiaoyi et al discuss the heat integration with the entrainer recovery costs in detail.

		<Title>Separation of Natural Gas</Title>
		<Description>
Background
One of the important process in the chemical engineering is the natural gas processing.
Moreover, improved production methods due to increased supply and decreased cost of natural gas
has gone to make the process much more significant. Though the composition of natural gas varies
from source to source but it mostly constitute of methane (85%) with small amount of ethane,
propane, n-butane, isobutane and heavier hydrocarbons. C2 and heavier hydrocarbons are more
valuable than methane and hence it is very important to recover them. C2 and heavier hydrocarbons
are called as Natural Gas Liquid. Recovery is accomplished in a series of five distillation columns.
Description of the Flowsheet
Recovery of hydrocarbons from the natural gas feed is achieved by using series of
distillation columns. First, methane is separated out in a high pressure cryogenic distillation column
using expansion. The column is named as de-methanizer and designed in a way to keep low
concentration of methane in its bottom product. The column is operated at 25 atm and 180 K. Deethanizer
is the second column used in the process to recover ethane. The column operates at 21 atm
and 264 K. Refrigeration is used in the condenser and column is designed such that distillate only
has specified concentration of propane impurity. De-propanizer is the third column used in the
process to recover propane as distillate, operating at 17 atm and 322 K. Cooling water is used in the
condenser and designed such that bottom only has specified concentration of propane impurity. Debutanizer
is the fourth column to carry n-butane and isobutane as overhead product for further
separation in another column. Due to lowest relative volatility of iC4/nC4, its separation is most
difficult. Hence its separation is performed after all the lighter and heavier components are
removed. Also it makes the process more economical. The column is operated with reflux drum
temperature of 322 K and 7.1 atm pressure.
The last column is de-isobuanizer. It separates isobutane as distillate and n-butane as bottom. The
column is designed in a way such that n-butane has specific concentration as impurity in distillate
and isobutane as impurity in bottoms. Column is operated at 322 K temperature and 6.6 atm
pressure.

		<Title>PRODUCTION OF AMMONIA THROUGH HABER‘S PROCESS</Title>
		<Description>
BACKGROUND
Ammonia is one of the most important chemicals used in industries for the commercial production of fertilizers and many other uses. It contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as precursor to food and fertilizers. The global production for ammonia was 176 million tonnes in 2014. Ammonia can be obtained by dry distillation of nitrogenous vegetable and animal waste products it can also be produced by the distillation of coal, but the most important process is Haber’s process being used worldwide for the production of ammonia.
DESCRIPTION OF FLOW SHEET
The process starts with mixing two streams of hydrogen at 1 bar and nitrogen at 8 bars which are introduced at 27 degrees and then fed to the compressor where the pressure is increased by 10 bar ,then they are introduced into to the equilibrium reactor where ,in the presence of iron catalyst at a temperature of around 850 degrees and at a pressure of around 100 bar , occurs an exothermic reversible reaction.
N2+3H2 ↔ 2NH3 ΔHr = -91796.00 KJ/kg
Ammonia is formed along with some unconverted hydrogen and nitrogen . The formed ammonia is then passed through a cooler, where it is cooled by extracting heat from it .Then the stream containing mixture of ammonia ,hydrogen and nitrogen is send to the component separator where the upper stream consisting of hydrogen is recycled back to the main stream of hydrogen via cooler where the temperature is considerably decreased from 857 K to 300 K and the other stream from the component separator consisting of a mixture of nitrogen and ammonia is given to the another component separator where pure stream of ammonia comes out as the main product and the nitrogen is again recycled back to the main stream via cooler .

		<Title>Synthesis of methanol</Title>
		<Description>
Background:
The by far dominating production method of methanol synthesis Is through the synthesis
gas process first developed during 1920.A gas mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide
(and also carbon dioxide)known as synthesis gas (syngas) is the basis for almost all methanol
production today.
The production of methanol basically consists of three main steps syngas preparation,
methanol synthesis and methanol purification
Description of flowsheet
The flowsheet used for methanol synthesis consist of a mixer to mix the recycle stream and
feed stream, conversion reactor,the cooler to cool the products,separator to separate gases
and the liquids and a purifier to purify the methanol.
First the feed consists of H2 and CO in the ratio of 2.25. The reactants are fed along with
the recycle of CO and H2 in to the conversion reactor.The reactions that are possible in the
conversion reactor are below.
CO + 2H2 => CH3OH
CO + 3H2 => CH4 + H2O
2CO + 2H2 => CH4 + CO2
The products from the reactor are then sent to a cooler unit where the products are cooled.
The gases and liquids that are formed due to cooling are separated and these gases are sent
to Recycle. H2 and CO are sent into the mixer to mix with feed stream. The liquid products are
then sent to a decompressor to decompress them to 14atm. And after decompressing these
sent to gas liquid separator to separate gases and liquids. The liquid product are sent to (CS)
compound separator to separate methanol form remaining components that are present.
We get methanol as the product.

		<Title>Production of Benzene via the hydrodealkylation of Toluene</Title>
		<Description>
Main reaction: Toluene + Hydrogen  Benzene +Methane
Reaction Conditions : 600 -650 deg C, 20 to 60 bar
Catalysis: Chromia on porous carrier
The process flow diagram for the process is shown in Figure 1.
The fresh toluene feed (no.1) along with recycle stream (no.11) is pressurized and mixed with hydrogen (no.3 and no. 5). The mixture is fed to a heater (E-101) followed by furnace heater (H-101) to increase the temperature to around 600 deg C. The heated stream (no.4) along with a small fraction of recycled hydrogen stream (no. 7) is introduced into a packed bed catalytic reactor (R-101). The reactor effluents are cooled and fed to phase separators (V-102 and V-103) to separate unreacted hydrogen along with product methane. A part of the separated gases is recycled back and the rest is collected as fuel gas (no.16). The liquid stream (no. 10) from the second phase separator is fed to distillation column after passing through the feed heater (E-103). The distillation column separates the light key component (benzene) which is subsequently cooled and stored (no.15). The bottom heavy component (toluene) is recycled back to the toluene vessel.
The following points need to be noted while creating this flowsheet in DWSIM:
a) A single heat exchanger was used to raise the feed temperature to the reaction temperature as there are no provisions of fired heater in DWSIM
b) The side reactions were ignored
c) The reactor operation was considered isothermal
d) One pass conversion of 75% was used for simulation
e) The three recycle loops (Two for hydrogen and one for toluene) were used. However, they were found to be extremely sensitive to the guess values fed to the solver and solutions were not converging. The initial guess values were improved by trial and error.
f) The data given in Turton et al, 2013 was used as the basis to create the sheet and confirm the simulation results from DWSIM
g) Instead of V-104, a phase separator was used to allow separation of vapors (no.19)

		<Title>ESTERIFICATION OF ACETIC ACID WITH 1-BUTANOL TO NBUTYLACETATE</Title>
		<Description>
Background
Esterification is a chemical process for making ester. The most common method of making esters are heating
carboxylic acid with an alcohol and removing water from it. Esters are normally produced by a batch process in
industries using mineral acid catalyst likeH2So4. The Esterification of acetic acid with 1-butanol is expressed as:-
1-butanol + Acetic acid ->

N-butyl acetate +Water
The reaction is a reversible reaction. N-Butyl acetate is used as a flavoring ingredient, solvent in the production of
lacquers and other products. It is also used in synthetic fruit flavoring.
Description of flow sheet
Two pure streams of 1-butanol and acetic acid at were fed into reactive distillation column at 50 kmol/hr, 1 atm and
298.15 K. Reactive distillation column was introduced from CAPE-OPEN and chemsep was used to input the data.
In a 34 stages simple distillation column acetic acid was fed at 13 stage and 1-butanol at 16 stage. Water and small
fraction of N-butyl acetate is obtained from top and from bottom N-Butyl acetate is obtained. To separate the water
and N-butyl acetate a decanter is used. Decanter was introduced from CAPE-OPEN using chemsep data. Reflux
ratio to operate the column is 2. Molar flow rate of product (N-butyl acetate) is 50.036 Kmol/hr and for by-product
(water) is 49.96 Kmol/hr.

		<Title>Production of Cumene from Benzene and Propylene</Title>
		<Description>
Background
Cumene, also known as isopropylbenzene, is used as a thinner in paints, lacquers and
enamels. It is a component of high octane motor fuels. Cumene is used to manufacture other
chemicals such as phenol, acetone, acetophenone and methyl styrene. It is also in used in the
manufacture of rubber, iron and steel, and pulp and paper.
The production of Cumene involves reaction of benzene with propylene in a high temperature, high
pressure gas phase reactor:
There is also a sequential reaction of cumene and propylene to form undesirable product, pdiisopropylbenzene:
Both these reactions are irreversible.
Description
Fresh feed streams of benzene and mixed C3 enters the process as liquids. Feed streams after being
mixed are fed to the vaporizer and leaves at 483.15 K and 25 bar. It is pre-heated in two heat
exchangers. The first recovers heat from the hot reactor effluent at 692.15 K. The second adds
additional heat to bring the reactor inlet temperature up to 647.15 K. Then the stream enters a
tubular reactor which leaves as reactor effluent at 692 K and is cooled to 607K through feedeffluent
heat exchanger.
The reactor effluent is further cooled down to 363 K using a condenser and sent to a flash drum by
reducing the pressure to 1.7 atm through a pressure reduction valve. The gas stream obtained from
the tank is used as fuel and the liquid stream is fed to first distillation column. The first column
comprises of 15 stages with feed being fed in the 8th stage. Benzene is obtained as distillate in the
top which is recycled back to the reactor. The stream obtained as bottoms is fed to another
distillation column. Second column has 20 stages and feed is sent in the 12th stage. Cumene of
higher purity is obtained as distillate and p-diisopropylbenzene is obtained in the bottoms.

		<Title>Air Separation Unit</Title>
		<Description>
Background and Description:
Air Separation Process is an integration of separation columns and heat exchanger. The
process is driven by compressing air at inlet of the unit. Compressed air is cooled and partially
liquefied against leaving product streams. In the first column, nitrogen is separated at a pressure of
6 bar and then condensed against boiling oxygen at a pressure around 1.2 bar. In the high pressure
column, liquid bottom product is rich in oxygen. The rich liquid is cooled using Joule-Thomson
effect to run the condenser of a side rectifier that separates Argon from Oxygen. It is fed with
vapour side draw from low pressure column. A part of air leaves the unit as waste stream due to the
additional requirement of cooling which is obtained using Joule-Thomson effect in an expander ,
which feeds compressed air directly to the low pressure column. Gaseous Oxygen and Nitrogen,
liquid Argon are obtained as products. Purity of Gaseous Oxygen ranges from 97.5 to 99.5 %.
Peng-Robinson Model was used to solve the flowsheet with binary interaction parameters as N2/O2
= -0.0133, N2/Ar = -0.0026, O2/Ar = 0.0089.
The liquid stream from the Argon Column is fed back to the low pressure column. This serves as
tear stream for the flowsheet. Following heat integrations in the Air Separation Unit is shown:
cooling of feed against products stream in main heat exchanger, Low Pressure condenser against
High Pressure reboiler, condensation of Argon against evaporization of rich liquid.
In the flowsheet, the purity of liquid argon and gaseous oxygen obtained are less than what they
normally are. This is due to limit in number of stages in the separation column used. If the Argon
Column is equipped enough stages along with structured packings, it is possible to reduce the
impurities to less than 1 ppm.

		<Title>Separation of Ethanol-water using benzene as Entrainer</Title>
		<Description>
Background
EtOH is naturally produced by fermentation of sugars by yeasts or via petrochemical processes.
Its chemical formula is C2H6O. Ethanol first use was to power an engine in 1826, and in 1876,
Nicolaus Otto, the inventor of the modern four-cycle internal combustion engine, used ethanol to
power an early engine. Ethanol is mostly used in beverage industry. Other industries in which
ethanol is used are paint, pharmaceuticals, etc.
Description
EtOH and water azeotrope mixture (0.87 EtOH and 0.13 H2O) at 100 Kmol/hr and temperature
311K is feed to distillation column at a stage 1. A mixture of EtOH, H2O and benzene from
make-up mixer is also feed to column at stage 5. From bottom of column a stream of ethanol is
obtained having 0.99 EtOH at 65.49Kmol/hr. A stream from bottom of decanter is feed to second
distillation column at stage 1. From the bottom of the second distillation column a stream is
obtained having 0.99 mole fraction water at 18.69 Kmol/hr. Top products from both the column
is feed to a mixture followed through a cooler. The cooled stream is feed to a decanter.

		<Title>Production of Formalin from Methanol</Title>
		<Description>
BACKGROUND
FORMALIN (37 wt% of formaldehyde in water) is majorly produced from methanol. Formaldehyde and urea is used to make urea-formaldehyde resins which is an adhesive use for plywood.
Methanol is oxidized in the presence of air to form formaldehyde and water and some of the methanol is also decomposed to give formaldehyde and hydrogen which is separated by compound separator.
CH3OH + O2 HCHO + H2O ΔHRXN = -37.3 kcal/mol
CH3OH HCHO + H2 ΔHRXN= 20.3 kcal/mol
PROCESS DESCRIPTION
Fresh Methanol (stream 2) mixes with recycle methanol (stream 18) in mixer (mixer-001) is pumped by pump (PUMP-001) and then passed through the heat exchanger to vaporised methanol. Stream 6 is at temperature 423.15 K and 314.7 kPa pressure. Fresh air which is mixture of oxygen and nitrogen is available at 250C and 1 atm. It is compressed (COMPRESSOR-001) to 300 kPa and is preheated by passing it through heat exchanger (HE-002) to temperature of 200oC and is mixed with vaporised methanol from stream 6 in mixer (MIXER-003) with is then feed to a reactor. Exothermic reaction occurs in the reactor with is operated at define outlet temperature with energy stream (ESTR-003).Conversion of methanol is around 80% for oxidation reaction and 25% for decomposition reaction. Output of reactor is again given to heat exchanger (HE-003) which decreases the temperature of stream to 360K. Outlet of heat exchanger (stream 10) is mixed with water (stream 1) in mixer (MIXER-004). Then it is given to the compound separator where hydrogen produce during decomposition of methanol is separated along with nitrogen present in air utilizing energy stream (ESTR-004).Some traces of formaldehyde, methanol and oxygen also separated in separator. Now outlet of separator is given to distillation column where separation of methanol from reaction mixture takes place. Condenser and reboiler duties are attached to the column. Heavy component is water and light is methanol. Formaldehyde will follow water as it is associated with it. Top product from column that is distillate is pumped through pump (PUMP-002) which is passed through recycle loop and is given to mixer (MIXER-001). Bottom product is collected and pumped through to higher pressure. Composition of product is around 32 mole% of formaldehyde with some traces of methanol present.

		<Title>Claude Process For Liquefying Methane</Title>
		<Description>
Abstract: Natural gas is predominantly methane. Liquefying natural gas has several advantages,
the main one being it’s transportation ease and safety. Claude refrigeration cycle is the basis of
various improvisations for liquefying natural gas. Claude cycle consists of all three processes for
liquefying gases. Namely isobaric cooling, throttling and expansion from which work is
obtained. Moreover recycle stream is heat integrated with feed stream.
Therefore the flow sheet converged is composed of 1. Mixer 2. Adiabatic compressor 3. Cooler
4. Heat exchangers 5. Splitter 6. Throttle valve 7. Gas-Liquid separator 8. Adiabatic expander
Flowsheet requires three recycle blocks.
Objective is to find what fraction of stream that enters regenerative system is liquefied? The
lesser is the temperature before throttling the more is the fraction methane liquefied.
One can also study effect of split ratio on liquefaction process.		</Description>

		<Title>Production of Cyclohexane through Catalytic Hydrogenation of Benzene</Title>
		<Title>Production of Cyclohexane through Catalytic Hydrogenation of Benzene</Title>
		<Description>Background Cyclohexane is industrially produced from Benzene as it is not a naturally available resource.
			Cyclohexane undergoes oxidation reactions yielding Cyclohexanone and Cyclohexanol which are precursors for the production of Adipic acid and Caprolactum.
			Caprolactum is the raw material used for producing polymer Nylon-6. Benzene reacts with a mixture of hydrogen and methane in contact with a
			Nickel based catalyst producing Cyclohexane. The conversion of this vapour phase reaction is almost 99%.
Reaction involved: Benzene + Hydrogen  Cyclohexane (Vapour Phase)
Reactor Used: Catalytic Packed Bed Conversion Reactor
Reactor conditions: Outlet Temperature = 497 K, Pressure Drop = 1.02 atm
Catalyst Used: Nickel Based Process Description Fresh benzene (370 kmol/h) and excess hydrogen (1470 kmol/h) is preheated to a temperature of 422 K and sent to a packed bed
			reactor. A vapour phase reaction occurs in the reactor at 497 K which converts benzene to cyclohexane through catalytic hydrogenation of benzene.
			The conversion of this reaction is about 99%. The reactor products are cooled to 370 K and sent through a pressure reduction valve which reduces the pressure
			of the stream from 30 atm to 24 atm. A two stage separator separates the product cyclohexane from unreacted hydrogen and methane- first
			at a high pressure (24 atm) and then at a lower pressure (3 atm). The unreacted hydrogen-methane mixture is recovered from the top of the flash column
			and is sent to a splitter having a splittling ratio of 9:1. The smaller stream is sent as a recycle stream and mixes with fresh hydrogen, while the rest is
			drawn out as fuel gas for incinerators. The bottom stream of the flash column having 99% (wt/wt) cyclohexane is sent as feed to a distillation column for
			further purification. The column consists of 12 stages operating at a reflux ratio of 5:1. The residue from the column has our desired product
			with a purity of 99.5% (wt/wt) cyclohexane.</Description>

		<Title>DEHYDRATION OF ETHANOL USING ETHYLENE GLYCOL AS ENTRAINER</Title>
		<Title>DEHYDRATION OF ETHANOL USING ETHYLENE GLYCOL AS ENTRAINER</Title>
		<Description>BACKGROUND: The demand for ethanol is more owing to its various assay requirements in fields of Research and Design laboratories for spectral photometric drug standardisation, industries as a raw material for esters, agent in gasoline to improve octane index. The methods used for dehydration includes heterogeneous azeotropic distillation, pervaporation membranes and extractive distillation with salts. However, heterogeneous azeotropic distillation presents some constraints in terms of high order of non- linearity, distillation boundaries in the residue curves, long transients, multiple steady states and specific thermodynamic models for simulation. This is an attempt to discuss ethylene glycol as the potential extractive agent. PROCESS OVERVIEW:
Ethylene Glycol is cheap, due to its extensive production as a part of manufacturing bio diesel. It also has the potential to modify the liquid-vapour equilibrium which helps in removing the water-ethanol azeotrope. Ethanol–water mixture at atmospheric pressure has a minimum-boiling homogeneous azeotrope at 78.1 C of composition 89 mol% ethanol. Thus, this mixture cannot be separated in a single distillation column and if it is fed to a column operating at atmospheric pressure, the ethanol purity in the distillate cannot exceed 89 mol% while high
purity water can be produced out from the bottom.
100 kmol/hr of an azeotropic feed is sent to the 10th stage of an 18 staged extractive distillation column. The entrainer make up along with the recycle from the Entrainer Recover column is sent to the 3rd stage. Glycerol changes the liquid activity coefficients, thereby the relative volatility leading to pure ethanol to the top and Glycerol- water mixture to the bottom. They are sent to the 4th stage of a 7 stage recovery column operating at a reduced pressure to separate the respective entrainer and water. Glycerol at the bottom is cooled recycled back to the extractive column and a small make up is added to account for entrainer losses.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. The operating pressure of entrainer recovery column is at 0.02 atmosphere to prevent thermal degradation of Glycol.
2. For a given Entrainer Feed Stage and Entrainer to Feed Molar ratio; there is an optimum reflux ratio that gives maximum ethanol purity. However, the value of the recycle ratio should be less to avoid energy losses during operation.
3. Entrainer feed stage should be near to the condenser to improve ethanol purity and has no significant effect on energy consumption.
4.Entrainer feed temperature has an important effect on the distillate composition and the reboiler energy consumption. It should be operated at temperature 5-15oC less than the top plate.
5. Residue curve - composition trajectory of the residue liquid in the still during open equilibrium evaporation. Residue curve map - diagram that shows residue curves for different initial still composition for a given mixture in the composition space. Saddle - singular point with finitely many paths both approaching and depart.

		<Title>Ethylbenzene Production From Ethylene And Benzene</Title>
		<Description>Background:
Ethylbenzene is almost exclusively (>99%) used as an intermediate for the manufacture of styrene monomer. Styrene production, which uses ethylbenzene as a starting material, consumes approximately 50% of the world’s benzene production. Less than 1% of the ethylbenzene produced is used as a paint solvent or as an intermediate for the production of diethylbenzene and acetophenone.
Ethylbenzene was first produced on a commercial scale in the 1930s in Germany and United States. Almost all ethylbenzene is produced commercially by alkylating benzene with ethylene, either in the liquid phase with aluminium chloride catalyst or in the vapor phase with a synthetic zeolite.
Description of the Flowsheet:
The ethylbenzene process involves the reaction of benzene with ethylene to form desired Ethylbenzene (EB) product. Herein, process undesirable product DEB (di-ethylbenzene) also forms due to side reaction. Herein, process benzene stream is fed up at rate of 630.6 kmol/h at 320K in mixer in which ethylene stream also mixed with same molar flow rate at 1 atm pressure. The well mixed slurry is fed up in Conversion Reactor-1 at 20 atm pressure where EB and DEB forms. Further this slurry is fed up in Conversion Reactor-2 with recycle stream of DEB at 19 atm pressure where DEB reacts with benzene to give EB. Herein, process for the separation of EB two distillation columns are used, in first DC-1 column benzene is recovered as distillate and recycle to mixer and at bottom EB and DEB found in proportion which further separated in DC-2 column. In DC-2 column EB is found in top product at rate 630.6 kmol/h and DEB found as bottom product which recycled to reactor-2 at 281.9 kmol/h.

		<Title>Methanol Synthesis From Syngas</Title>
		<Description>Background:
In presents day methanol is considered as important fuel because it may provide various petroleum based-liquid
fuels and its extensive used is done because of its availability. It can be form by any renewable biomass hydrocarbon
source by partial oxidation to produce synthesis gas, which is then converted into methanol.
Here, simulation carried out for a process which converts synthesis gas into methanol. In process conversion reactor
is used to react hydrogen with the carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in the synthesis gas to produce methanol.
Flowsheet Description:
Herein, process fixed amount of synthesis gas is used for feed. In process, “Peng-Robinson” property model is used
except distillation column. The process can divided into four section,
(1) Compression and Reactor Preheating
(2) Reactor
(3) Separator, Recycle, and Vent
(4) Flash and Distillation
In compression, synthesis gas at 51.2 bar is compressed in a two-stage compression system to 110 bar. Then three
recycle gas streams are added, and the gas stream enters in heat exchanger at 53°C. Here, for reaction conversion
reactor is used, in which two reactions carried out with 64% and 17% conversion of carbon monoxide and carbon
dioxide respectively. After complete reaction reactor effluent is cooled to 174°C in heat exchanger, it is further
cooled to 38°C. Then most of vapor stream is compressed back to 110 bar and fed up into high pressure separator,
from which a small fraction is vented off at a flow rate of 840 kmol/h. For removing light components from the
stream flash separator is used which operated at 2 bar. The liquid from the separator is fed up in 42-stage distillation
column on stage 27. The column operates at 1 bar; a small vapor side stream from the column is recycled and is
compressed back up to 110 bar. From the column at top High pure methanol about (99%) is obtained and as bottom
(99%) water obtained. From the process simulation following graph and results obtained.</Description>

		<Title>TRIPLE PRESSURE SWING COLUMN FOR SEPARATION OF TERNARY
ACETONITRILE-METHANOL-BENZENE AZEOTROPIC SYSTEM</Title>
		<Description>Operational Relevance:
A complex and common ternary mixture of Acetonitrile-Methanol-Benzene mixture is
encountered in Chemical and Pharmaceutical industries. Acetonitrile is used in Lithium ion batteries,
Methanol with the recent implementations to blend in with petrol to mitigate pollution and Benzene
in the polystyrene industries. The exposure to these chemical cause irritation of central nervous
systems. Therefore , its attractive and necessary to separate and reuse these chemicals to protect
environment and conserve resource. It is difficult to attain with conventional distillation due to
presence of a ternary azeotrope with varied distillation boundaries.
		The influence of pressure on the azeotropic composition and temperature is a decisive factor and
Residue Curve maps at different operating pressures are used to ascertain the optimization
parameters for this multi-component separation. A pressure swing moves the distillation boundaries
that lie between the corresponding purity values of desired products, thereby making the separation
feasible.
Process Flowsheet:
The process consists of 3 Pressure swing columns (referred C1,C2,C3) operating at 608-
101.326-608 KPa pressures respectively. 1000 kg/hr of feed (0.7 M - 0.2 A- 0.1B) is fed to the 37th
stage of a 47 staged distillation column (C1) along with the recycle stream of the C3 fed to 28th
stage. The bottoms has pure Acetonitrile while the distillate (D1) is sent to C2 where it is faced with
a reduced pressure. D1 is fed to the 18th stage of a 50 staged Column with the bottoms yielding
pure methanol and overhead (D2) fed to C3. D2 is fed to the fourth of 14 staged column where the
bottoms is pure benzene and the overhead is recycled back to C1. The Residue Curve Map for the

		<Title>Tetrahydrofuran/Water Pressure Swing Azeotripic Distillation</Title>
		<Description>Background:
Simulations were performed to obtain highly pure tetrahydrofuran (THF) with over 99.9 mole% from the mixture of THF and water. Pressure swing distillation (PSD) was used since the azeotropic point between tetrahydrofuran and water can be varied with pressure. A commercial process simulator, PRO/II with PROVISION release 8.3, was used for the simulation studies. The Wilson liquid activity coefficient model was used to simulate the low pressure column, and the Peng-Robinson equation of state model was added to correct the vapour phase non-idealities for the modelling of the high pressure column.
Description of the Flowsheet:
The water pressure swing azeotropic distillation process involves the separation of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and water mixer and to form desired water product and tetrahydrofuran product. Herein no side products produce during the process. Here mixer of raw materials fed up in the heat exchanger1 (H/E1) with 2000kmol/h at 308K and 1 atm pressure. The outlet of H/E1 fed up to the distillation column1 (DC1) and top product of DC1 fed up to the H/E2 through the pump. Bottom product of DC1 further fed up in the H/E1 and outlet of the H/E1 having 0.99999 water.
From the H/E2 the material fed into the distillation column2 (DC2) and top product of DC2 fed up to the DC1 with 276.68 kmol/h. bottom product of DC2 fed into the H/E2 and outlet of H/E2 having .09999 THF.

		<Title>Simulation and Optimization of TEALARC LNG Plant</Title>
		<Description>About Flowsheet:
Herein, process simulation is carried out for TEALARC LNG Plant in which liquefied natural gas (LNG)
produced. The LNG was produced by use of refrigeration cycle which made up of four major
components: compressor, evaporator, expansion valve and condenser. Basically, refrigeration system
removes energy from a low-temperature region and transfer heat to a high-temperature region. Mainly
there are two types of refrigeration cycle; here we considered vapor compression cycle.
In TEALARC LNG Plan there are two sections to be consider are:
- pre-cooling cycle
- liquefaction cycle
Pre-cooling cycle: This cycle primarily consists of propane and ethane gas which is cooled from a
temperature of about 86°C to -64°C at a five pressure level. The cooling is achieved by the use of cooler
and energy is recycled by use of thermal energy mixer which can give further energy to heater for heating
purpose. Herein, flowsheet it noted with (PLNG100; PLNG101; PLNG102). The adiabatic compressor is
used to compress the vapour to about 2260KPa at three pressure level. The compressed stream is further
condensed and recycles back to cooler to continue he circulation.
Liquefaction cycle: The liquefaction cooling cycle consists two compressors and gas-liquid separator and
there is also heating and cooling arrangement is controlled via use of thermal energy mixer which noted
as (LNG100; LNG101; LNG102). In separator vapor and liquid fraction is spitted.
In process, treated natural gas is feed into heat-exchanger where, is cooled from 30°C to about -52°C
while second outlet stream of exchanger is superheated from about -56°C to about -4°C. This stream is
compressed by compressors (K102 and K101) and subsequently cooled and recycled to pre-cooling plant.
The natural gas feed is further sub-cooled in cooler and partially liquefied. After that it further cooled and
liquefied at it’s at a temperature of -157°C, which is about the boiling point temperature of methane gas.
The pressure of the natural gas stream is further reduced to the atmospheric pressure with the help of the
expander there by reducing the temperature to about -163°C. Then, liquefied natural gas is flashed. From
the simulation following results obtained:</Description>

		<Title>BTX DIVIDED WALL COLUMN</Title>
		<Description>About flowsheet:
The divided-wall column is a practical way to implement the topology of the Petlyuk column that features two columns with interconnected vapor and liquid streams arising from a single reboiler and a single condenser. The dynamic control of the divided-wall column has been explored in a relatively small number of papers. Control is more difficult than with a conventional two-column separation sequence because there is more interaction among controlled and manipulated variables since the four sections of the column are coupled.
The BTX involves separation of benzene, toluene and p-xylene mixture and to form desire products. In the process three side stream produce. Here raw material fed up in to the prefrac column with 1 kmol/s, 358 K and 1atm pressure.

		<Title>Energy Efficient Hybrid Separation Processes</Title>
		<Description>Acetic acid is the second simplest carboxylic acid (after formic acid). It consists of a methyl
group attached to a carboxyl group. It is an important chemical reagent and industrial chemical, used
primarily in the production of cellulose acetate for photographic film, polyvinyl acetate for wood glue,
and synthetic fibers and fabrics. In households, diluted acetic acid is often used in descaling agents. In
the food industry, acetic acid is controlled by the food additive code E260 as an acidity regulator and as
a condiment. In biochemistry, the acetyl group, derived from acetic acid, is fundamental to all forms of
life. In this flow sheet the final product Pure Acetic acid which is produced by methods of Energy
Efficient Hybrid Separations of Acetic acid and water using ethyl acetate as a solvent.
Hybrid Separations utilize distillations, extraction, absorptions and other concepts. These methods
increase the efficiency with reducing costs of production. They also help in saving energy by reducing its
consumption. Therefore, this method is becoming widely known and is being used for manufacturing
several chemicals of industrial importance.
Process Description:
First the acid water feed is fed into the extractive distillation column at a temperature of 298.15K and
101325 Pa pressure. Solvent recycled from the Decanter is also added to this column. At the end of this
process we have an Extract and Raffinate.
The Extract is sent to the acid recovery column to produce a top product and an acid product. The acid
product is removed and the top product is cooled using a cooler to 298.15K This mixture is then sent to
a decantation unit.
The Raffinate is sent to the mixer where water from the decanter is mixed and it goes to solvent
recovery unit in which steam is also added at 373.15K and 101325 Pa pressure. The top product is sent
to a cooler which after cooling is sent to the decantation unit.
Therefore, there are two feeds coming into the decantation unit. Both cooled to 298.15K. After
Decantation takes place, the bottom product which is water is send to mixer for further use in the
solvent recovery unit and the top product is sent to a mixer where make up ethyl acetate is added. This
mixture is recycled back to the first distillation column and enters the distillation column with the acid
water feed.
The molar flow rate of acetic acid, ethyl acetate and water is shown in the Results table below.
Therefore, high purity acetic acid is obtained by Hybrid Separation Processes which are energy efficient,
considerably reducing costs.

		<Title>NATURAL GAS PROCESSING SIMULATION</Title>
		<Description>
			INTRODUCTION
GAIL, Gandhar plant is one of the major plants of Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL). Natural gas being one of the most important raw materials containing light hydrocarbons with different uses has to be processed to get desired light hydrocarbons for designated usage.
In the Gandhar plant, Natural Gas supplied by ONGC is processed to get LPG, pentane and lean gas as output. The design capacity of the plant is 5.0 MMSCMD, though it is currently running at 4.2 MMSCMD due to decreased supply of Natural Gas as less available currently. This plant is designed by Engineers India Ltd. (EIL). Many of the plants’ equipments have been licensed by various licensing companies, including SOLAR Turbines Inc., Linde, ROTOFLOW, PSA Nitrogen Limited while the Plant Control Interface Software was licensed by Honeywell automation. The cost of the project is Rs. 356 crores generating sales of 82 lakhs per day from LPG, 30 lakhs per day from Naphtha, 3.5 lakhs per day from Pentane leading to a consolidated turnover of 3332 Lakhs per month. The expenditures amount to 2323 lakhs per month. Thus, GAIL earns a net profit of around 900 lakhs PM MOTIVATION BEHIND THE PROJECT
The plant design made of equipments coming from different licensors and currently handling such large volumes of natural gas input makes the simulation necessary to look for various areas of improvement possible. One of the major regions of concern before building such a plant on a large scale is whether the plant will work for the given conditions of equipment working as well as of the raw material. This can be investigated theoretically first by simulations, to verify the validity of the process flowsheet.
Another important motivation behind this project was aimed towards analyzing usage of Open Source process simulation software DWSIM as compared to the normal licensed softwares such ASPEN which is one of the most preferred softwares for such applications in the industry. The software licensing costs are quite high and using open source software could considerably decrease these expenses which are significant towards developing chemical plants. To comprehend the level of reliability and versatility of open source softwares, one good way would be to simulate existing plants demonstrating the same using them.
Thus, need for improvement for getting better profits as well as to analyze and comprehend the robustness of open source software DWSIM makes the project a good thing to work upon.

			All the data pertaining to the process were input at the required place. The following assumptions were taken:
The input raw material has zero water vapour. This was assumed to remove dryer as a component in the flowsheet as water would not affect any process ahead and adding a complex component like dryer is difficult in DWSIM
The heat integration and energy integration implemented in the chiller as well as the compressor-expander system was not done as efficiency of its working is not known. Since, we knew the parameters of input and output streams of these sections, we are able to take the streams ahead for further processing in the software.
4 Chiller streams are provided as per need but separately and not in one common unit for simplicity purposes.product stream specifications

		<Title>Industrial production of Acetone by dehydrogenation of Isopropanol</Title>
		<Description>BACKGROUND:
Acetone is one of the most important industrial solvent being used in industries from a long back. A lot of interest is being shifted to acetone derived chemicals .It is widely used as a volatile compound in paints and varnishes .the global requirement of acetone in India is estimated to be 55000 tons annually It was initially prepared by dry distillation of metal acetates but recently a number of methods have been devolved including biosynthesis, Cumene process etc .One of the most economical process is by the dehydrogenation of Isopropanol followed by fractionation.
PROCESS DESCRIPTION:
The process starts with a pure stream of Isopropanol being introduced in an equilibrium reactor, where a temperature of 530 K and a pressure drop of 10 bars is maintained .On an account endothermic reaction takes place and heat is absorbed during the process.
CH3CH (OH) CH3  -> CH3COCH3 + H2 ΔHr= +57000KJ/Kmol
.The top product of the reactor is given to a flash separator, where a pressure drop of 2000 pa is maintained and hydrogen is separated as a lighter product at the top and mixture of Isopropanol and acetone is taken as a bottom product .This product is then mixed with the stream from the end process and fed to a 12 stage distillation tower, where a pressure of 1 atm and a reflux ratio of 1.5 is maintained. The top product contains pure Acetone having purity of 99 percent and the side stream and bottom product contains mixture of Isopropanol and traces of acetone which again given to a distillation column where same conditions are maintained, the bottoms and the side stream of this column contains Isopropanol which is recycled back and mixed with the feed of distillation column. In this process 99 percent of acetone is produced with most of the unreacted Isopropanol being recycled and energy is recycled wherever feasible.</Description>

		<Title>CONVENTIONAL/ UNUSUAL PRESSURE SWING DISTILLATION OF ISOBUTANOL AND N-HEPTANE</Title>
		<Description>Here simulation is carried out for separation of Isobutanol and N-heptane which generated during production of triisobutyl vanadate. This mixture is separated for the reuse of the reactants to reduce cost of raw material. For the separation of this mixture special distillation techniques may used like Azeotropic distillation, Extractive distillation, Pressure Swing distillation etc. But among this pressure swing distillation (PSD) received research attention because of its advantages like simple configuration, possibility of heat integration and main not to require third component as used in Azeotropic distillation.
Pressure Swing Distillation is commonly used for azeotrope separation in which based on changing pressure the separation makes easier as pressure is changed the composition of mixture also changes which then form minimum or maximum azeoptrope. Herein case for isobutanol if pressure is increased then minimum azeotrope will move to maximum azeotrope [1].
PROCESS: Here two flowsheet are simulated for the separation of isobutanol and N-heptane. For simulation data are obtained from Yinglong Wang’s works .Two flowsheet simulated one of conventional pressure swing distillation and second one unusual pressure swing distillation. Both are same except unusual pressure swing distillation in which one of the product is carried out from top of the column and in conventional all products withdrawn from bottom of columns. In both flowsheet feed is contains 0.2 mol N-heptane and 0.8 mol isobutanol. However recycle stream having different proportion of mole fraction of both component and also molar flow. For getting nearer results to literature here NRTL method used and also coefficient data are fitted. Below data are used for column set-up.
		For simulation I assumed here that feed stream will have temeperature of 40°C and also Isobutanol is taken as 2-methyl-1-propanol due to unavailability in DWSIM database for isobutanol component. LPC (low pressure column) operates at 1 atm pressure in which isobutanol is separated at bottom of the column at a rate of 80.06 Kmol/h and top product of the column is sent to HPC (high pressure column) which operates at 4 atm pressure from this column N-heptane is obtained as bottom product and top product is recycle back to LPC at a rate of 49.07 Kmol/h.
		Unusual Pressure Swing Distillation:
Here same condition assumed that feed will have temperature of 40°C and enters in LPC which operates at 1 atm pressure from the column as bottom product isobutanol is obtained at a rate of
80.08 Kmol/h and top product is sent to HPC which operates at 12 atm pressure from which as a top product N-heptane is obtained and bottom product is recycle back to LPC at a rate of 51.55 Kmol/h.
		During simulation it’s observed that process has sensitivity toward selection of proper coefficient calculation method because the selections of method directly influence the purity data of both columns.

benzene is vaporised in heat exchanger E601 and then mixed with compressed
air .the mixture is sent to fired heater to heat the feed to desired temperature inlet
conditions.the reaction is highly exothermic and hence ration of air to benzene in the
feed mixture is kept high.conversion reactor is used to convert benzene into maleic
anhydride and combustion products .the unreacted benzene ,maleic anhydride and
combustion products are cooled and sent to absorption tower (compound separator)
for separation of combustion gases and product an organic solvent (dibutyl phthalate)

		<Title>Design of an industrial 1,4- Dioxane Dehydration process with light feed impurity</Title>
		<Description>A. Process Flow Sheet Description
The process involves a feed stream (S-1) comprising of aqueous 1,4-Dioxane and water with small amounts of light impurity Tri-Ethylamine (TEA) fed to a pre-concentrator column in order to remove the impure TEA. The bottom product of DC-1 (S-3) is recycled along with the distillate stream (S-7) of DC-3 and feed to DC-2. Thus, with a low-pressure column (DC-2) operating at 1 atm and a high-pressure column operating at 8 atm (DC-3), 1,4-Dioxane and water can be separated using a two column sequence. Streams S-6 and S-8 are rich in water and 1,4 -Dioxane appropriately.
B. Results and Discussion
A rigorous column (DC-1) was simulated for the separation of Tri-Ethylamine with number of stages set to 7 and a bottoms rate of 1177.16 kg/h . Two rigorous columns (DC-2 and DC-3) were implemented to separate 1,4-Dioxane and water. The number of stages and product mass flowrates were provided as specifications.

		<Title>PRODUCTION OF ETHYLENE GLYCOL</Title>
		<Description>BACKGROUND Ethylene glycol is a chemical commonly used in many commercial and industrial applications including antifreeze and coolant. Ethylene glycol helps keep your car’s engine from freezing in the winter and acts as a coolant to reduce overheating in the summer. Ethylene glycol also is used as a raw material in the production of a wide range of products including polyester fibers for clothes, upholstery, carpet and pillows. The global production of Ethylene glycol is 7 x 106 tons/annum.Ethylene glycol can be obtained by Ethylene carbonate process, union carbide syngas process and many other processes but the most important process is hydrolysis of Ethylene oxide. DESCRIPTION OF FLOWSHEET
Each mole of Ethylene oxide reacts with a mole of water to give rise to one of Ethylene Glycol. But the product Ethylene Glycol formed reacts with Ethylene Oxide to give rise to Diethyleneglycol. The reactions are as follows.
𝐶2𝐻4𝑂+ 𝐻2𝑂 −→ 𝐶2𝐻6𝑂2 𝐶2𝐻4𝑂+ 𝐶2𝐻6𝑂2−→ 𝐶4𝐻10𝑂3
In order to increase the yield of Ethylene Glycol 20 moles of water is fed to the reactor for each mole of Ethylene glycol entering. However, a maximum of around 90 % yield of Ethylene glycol is only obtained by non-catalytic reaction/ process. The Ethylene oxide limiting reactant and undergoes complete conversion in plug-flow reactor.
Therefore the reaction mixture consists large amounts of water which is mostly removed by employing multiple effect feed forward evaporators. The pressure decreases in the forward direction . The concentrated solution contains % of Glycols and rest water. Therefore water is mostly removed in multi-stage plate distillation column. The Ethylene glycol is finally removed in the next distillation which is also a multi-stage plate column.

		<Description>Azeotropes are close boiling mixtures which are difficult to separate through simple
distillation. To separate azeotropic mixtures another light component is added to mixture
through which a binary minimum boiling azeotrope can be formed. Bottom is generally
obtained as high purity product and top product is near to heterogeneous azeotrope. This top
product can be sent to decanter for separation in aqueous and organic streams. Organic phase
is sent to back to column whereas aqueous stream is processed as per requirement
Description:
Wu et al [1] devised a two-column design with a bottom decanter. The reproduced flowsheet
is shown in Figure 1. The bottom composition of the distillation column was designed to be
near MMA/H2O azeotrope so that a decanter can be designed to obtain aqueous and organic
streams. The system is shown which contains two column and one recyle stream.
The top product from column-I is 95.3% Methanol and bottom product is mixed with recycle
from column-II and sent to decanter at 323.15 K. The bottom product from decanter is 99%
water and top product is again sent to column for further separation. The bottom product of

		<Title>Neat Operation for Separating Methanol-Water</Title>
		<Description>Neat operation means the condenser duty required in the one column is exactly equal to the reboiler duty in the next column. Here the system used is Methanol-Water. Methnol is more volatile so it is obtained as Distillate in both the units with purity around 99% . The water is obtained from the bottoms in each column which is around 99% pure.
The feed composition is 60 mol % Methanol and 40mol % Water flowing at a rate of 1 kmol/s. The feed is split in the ratio of 0.5086 and 0.4914 kmol/s so that the column operates “neat”.
The low pressure column-I operates at 0.6 atm and column-II operates at 5 atm. Reflux ratio in column-II is 2 so that heat duty of condenser-I and reboiler-II are same.
		The component purity of each stream is around 99 %.As condenser duty in Column-I is same as Reboiler Duty in Column-II that is 33188 kW. By this operation total capital investment and energy consumption is reduced.

		<Title>PREPARATION OF ACETIC ACID BY OXIDATION OF ACETALDEHYDE</Title>
		<Description>Acetic acid is the second, simplest carboxylic acid (after formic acid). It consists of a methyl group attached to a carboxyl group. It is an important chemical reagent and industrial chemical, used primarily in the production of cellulose acetate for photographic film, polyvinyl acetate for wood glue, and synthetic fibres and fabrics. In households diluted acetic acid is often used in de-scaling agents.
Description of the flowsheet:
This flowsheet is used for the production of acetic acid by oxidation of acetaldehyde, consists of a mixer to mix the recycle stream with the feed streams, conversion reactor, the cooler to cool the products, complex column to separate the product (acetic acid) and unreacted feed, followed by absorption column to separate Nitrogen from unreacted feed using water as an absorbent. Complex column is used to separate water from recycle stream.
Reaction:
CH3CHO + 0.5O2 ---> CH3COOH Description:
The products from the reactor are then sent to the cooler unit where the products are cooled. Then acetic acid is separated from unreacted acetaldehyde and air component using complex column based on the volatility of the compounds. The product acetic acid is
obtained from bottom stream of the complex column. The unreacted stream obtained from complex column is sent to a heater to vaporize for better absorption of acetaldehyde in absorption column to separate nitrogen gas from the unreacted part to minimise the nitrogen content in recycle stream. Water is used as an absorbent which is separated using a complex column from unreacted acetaldehyde and recycle back and some make-up water is added with recycle stream and cooled using a cooler for better absorption of acetaldehyde. Top product form complex column is heated to make the top effluent at room temperature. The stream, contained acetaldehyde and oxygen, is sent to a mixer through a recycle block to increase the overall yield.

		<Title>Extractive Distillation for Dehydration of Tetrahydrofuran</Title>
		<Description>Extractive distillation technique for the dehydration of Tetrahydrofuran is investigated with Ethylene glycol as an entrainer. Two columns are used, Top product from the first column is desired product that is Tetrahydrofuran and other column is for entrainer recovery. The entrainer from the bottom of second column is recycled back with the feed stream with makeup.
Introduction:
Tetrahydrofuran is an important organic raw material. The demand for high purity Tetrahydrofuran is continuously increasing as it can be used as reaction solvent, adhesives etc. but it is commercially beneficial only when available in high purity i.e. 99.9% wt. basis. At atmospheric pressure Tetrahydrofuran gets easily dissolved in water and forms a minimum-boiling homogeneous azeotrope. Therefore it is not possible to separate Tetrahydrofuran-Water solution completely by Simple Distillation.
There are various methods available for separating Tetrahydrofuran-Water Azeotropic mixture like pressure swing distillation, pervaporation, and extractive distillation. Among these techniques the most commonly used method for Tetrahydrofuran dehydration is Extractive Distillation in which the addition of a separating agent is applied to increase the relative volatility of light and heavy components.
Flowsheet Description:
Fan et al [1] devised a two-column design with an entrainer. The reproduced flowsheet is shown in Figure 1. Among the various entrainer available like DMSO, DMF here ethylene glycol is used as it is easily and cheaply available. In Figure-I column-I is extractive column and column-II is for recovery of entrainer ethylene glycol. The azeotropic mixture of Tetrahydrofuran-Water along with entrainer is fed to column-I the top product of column-I is our desired product i.e. 99.9 wt. % Tetrahydrofuran. The bottom product is fed to column-II for entrainer recovery where ethylene glycol is separated from water and separated ethylene glycol is then obtained from the bottom with 99.9 wt. % purity. This entrainer is again recycled to column-I after cooling and adding make-up stream of entrainer to account for the loss of entrainer in distillates of column-I and column-II
Fresh feed flow rate is kept at 3000 kg/hr containing 0.9 wt. % Tetrahydrofuran and rest water at a temperature of 320 K. The pressure of both the columns are maintained at 1.1 atm. Distillate from column-I is our desired product i.e. Tetrahydrofuran with 99.9 wt. % purity.

		<Title>FOR PRODUCTION OF ACETONE VIA DEHYDRogenaTION OF ISOPROPANOL</Title>
		<Description>Acetone is a colourless , volatile, flammable liquid , and is
the
simplest and smallest ketone
2.
It is miscible with water and serves as an important solvent in
its own right, typically for cleaning purposes in laboratories
3.
Acetone is produced and disposed of in the human body
through normal metabolic processes
4.
It is normally present in blood and urine. People
with diabetes produce it in larger amounts.
5.
Reproductive toxicity tests show that it has low potential to
cause reproductive problems
DESCRIPTION :
The production of acetone involves the dehydrogenation of IPA
in a high temperature gas phase reactor
(CH3)2CHOH--> CH3)2CO + H2
Turtonet al6 assumed the reaction to be irreversible and
specify that the per pass conversion of IPA is 90% to prevent side
reactions. The reaction occurs in the vapour phase in the
presence of a solid catalyst
			Using
the reactor size and kinetics given in Turton et al as shown in
Table 1 gave the 90% conversion specified by the authors if the presence of the solid
catalyst was neglected. Of course, the catalyst is present, so a bigger reactor would have
to be used to give the same conversion.
The
kinetics used by Turton et al are also unrealistic in that the
reaction cannot be irreversible. If it were irreversible, we could operate at high pressure,
which would raise the concentration of IPA and drive the reaction toward the products.
But LeChatier’s principle tells us that raising pressure should drive the reaction toward the
reactant since there are two moles of product generated from one mole of reactant. In an
attempt to modify the kinetics so as to capture these realistic effects, an RGIBBS reactor
was run in Aspen Plus to find the effect of pressure on conversion. At 623 K (the
temperature in the Turton flowsheet), the RGIBBS equilibrium conversion is 97.1% at 2 atm.
This should be compared with the 90% conversion in the Turton design. As pressures are
raised to 5, 10, and 15 atm , the equilibrium conversions decrease to 93.3, 87.8, and 83.2%.
Clearly the effect of pressure must be considered.
The
kinetics were modified to assume a reversible reaction :
(CH3)2CHOH --> (CH3)2CO + H2
The activation energy of the forward reaction used is the value given in Turton et al (72
380 kJ/ kmol ). The activation energy of the reverse reaction was calculated using the heat
of reaction (+62 900 kJ/ kmol
λ= EF ER
			An empirical trial
and error procedure was employed to
find the unknown values of the pre exponential factors kF and kR
that satisfied two conditions. First, they should give approximately
the same pressure dependence of conversion in a large tubular
reactor as predicted by RGIBBS. Second, they should give 90%
conversion when used in the Turton tubular reactor (including the
presence of catalyst). Table 1 shows the parameters used in the
rest of this study. To be consistent with the assumption made by
Turton , the conversion in the reactor is held at 90% as other design
parameters are changed.

		<Title>PRODUCTION OF DIETHYL ETHER FROM ETHANOL BY DEHRATION</Title>
		<Description>Diethyl ether (C2H5)2O is an organic compound which is also known as
ethyl ether, ether or ethoxyethane. It is a colourless, highly volatile flammable
liquid with a characteristic odour. It is commonly used as a solvent and as a
general anesthetic. It has narcotic properties so it has been known to cause
temporary psychological addiction, sometimes referred to as etheromania.
Diethyl ether may have been created by either JabiribnHayyan in the
8th century or RaymundusLullus in 1275, as there is no any evidence of this. It
was first synthesized in 1540 by ValeriusCordus, who called it “sweet oil of
vitriol” (oleum dulcevitrioli) - the name reflects the fact that it is obtained by
distilling a mixture of ethanol and sulfuric acid (then known as oil of vitriol). At
about the same time, Paracelsus discovered the ether’s analgesic properties
in chickens. The ether name comes in 1730 by August Sigmund Frobenius.
		The flowsheet for the Diethyl ether production consist of a mixer to mix the recycle
stream (ethanol) and Ethanol feed stream,Conversion reactor and two Distillation
columns .One distillation column is to purify diethyl ether and later is for seperating
water and recycle stream.About 50% conversion is obatined in the conversion reactor
with reaction as follows
2 C2H5OH > (C2H5)2O + H2O
The product from the mixer is sent to the coversion reactor ,the product from the reactor
is sent to the Distillation column 1 to seperate pure Diethyl ether and mixed bottom which
is a feed to the Distillation column 2 where recycle ethanol stream and water are being
seperated. All the streams are at Atmospheric pressure.

		<Title>Production of Ethylene Oxide by Air (Oxygen) oxidation process</Title>
		<Description>
			A. Background
Ethylene Oxide production plant is downstream plant of Gas Cracker. Ethylene Oxide is widely used in production of Ethylene Glycol. In US and also in India, Ethylene Oxide has principle outlet in production of Ethylene Glycol. It also used as other derivatives like glycol polyesters, non-ionic detergents and ethanol-amines. This project relates actual plant production of ethylene oxide using ethylene and oxygen.
			B. Description of Flowsheet
Ethylene from Gas Cracker plant and Oxygen from Air Separation plant are come to Ethylene Oxide (EO) plant. Then it compressed to 21.7 bar (2170 kPa) in compressor for achieving reaction pressure. Then oxygen goes to oxygen mixing station, where oxygen is carefully supplied. After that, mixture goes to Shell and Tube Reactor, where partial oxidation of Ethylene takes place in presence of silver (Alumina based) catalyst. Only 12 % of Ethylene converted to EO. Some CO2 also produced during reaction. After reaction, EO, CO2 and unreacted feed are going to absorption column. In absorption column, most of the EO is absorbed in water and lean EO stream goes to heat-exchanger. Lean EO stream consist mainly Ethylene, Oxygen and CO2. It will exchange heat with reactor outlet stream. After exchanging heat, this stream will go to reactor feed stream via recycle. Absorption column bottom goes to disorber, where some amount of water removed. The top of column will go to further purification in stripper and distillation column. After purification, pure Ethylene Oxide get it from top and it send to EO storage tank.
		C. Result
The capacity of production of Ethylene Oxide is 79.95 ton/day. The reaction temperature is around 250-300 0C and pressure is 21.7 bar. 12 % conversion of Ethylene was taken as a real plant information. Side reaction as formation of CO2 also produced in very small amount was taken. Reactor outlet was sent to heat exchanger and then to absorption column. Lean gases are found at the top. They are recycled back to main feed stream. Rich water + gases are sent to distillation column. Rigorous column was taken for distillation using shortcut distillation column data. In both column, Ethylene Oxide taken as light key and water taken as heavy key. Two distillation columns required to remove almost all water. As per data of shortcut column, reflux ratio of 1st column taken 16 (above minimum), 35 stages (as suggested) and for 2nd column reflux ratio taken 2.5 (above minimum), 5 stages (as suggested). It was then simulated and 79.95 ton/day (0.9254 kg/s) obtained.
			D. Conclusion and Recommendation
DWSIM provides good platform for simulation. With the knowledge of DWSIM, one can simulate plant. That data can further be use to design equipment as in chemical engineering, process equipment design. The stripper column not work good in DWSIM. Using script, future work can be done. Purging is also not available. Stream splitter is also not very much effective. If in future, purging is available, then flowsheet will be more effective. Also, in rigorous column, FUG, Mac-Cab-Thiele, etc popular methods not available. It might be available in future. Using that, one can understand better.

		<Title>Steady State Simulation of Separation Column for Propylene-Propane Mixture</Title>
		<Description>Propylene is one of the most significant intermediate petrochemical products. The blend of propylene, propane, C-5 fraction, hexane, water, hydrogen, N2 and some other constituents from a petrochemical plant are the raw material. Due to necessity of a high purity feed stream propylene has to be separated from propane and the other impurities in the separation column. The simulation of the propane-propylene separation column was carried out using DWSIM simulation engine, to determine the effect of the main operating parameters on the product composition. The similarities in physical and chemical properties between the molecules lead to separation of propylene from mixture being problematic. Due to the high product purity and the low relative volatility, the number of stages required generally for this separation is very high. The process requires high capital cost and energy consumption. To maximize profit, as energy prices rise, energy efficiency, together with optimizing product quality and maximizing high–value product yields have become more important. Thus, modification of propane/propylene separation process can highly affect the economics of the whole production system.
		The Soave—Redlich—Kwong which is an equation of state thermodynamic property model is selected for the simulation.
The ternary feed mixture of Propane, Propylene and n-Pentane mixture is fed into the mixer at a molar flow rate of 45.2385, 79.012 and 1.2599 mol/s respectively, temperature of 310.92 K, and pressure of 1999 kPa. The pump is employed to increase the pressure to 2137kPa. The feed then enters at 70th stage of stripping column (Reboiled absorber) which has a total of 100 stages and maintained at top pressure of 1931 kPa and bottom pressure of 2068 kPa with a pressure drop of 0.2 psia. Due to the high product purity and the low relative volatility, the number of stages required for separation is very high.
3
The distillate has a mole fraction of 0.5295 Propylene and 0.4704 Propane which is further sent to the Refluxed Absorber of 120 stages. 0.9900 mole fraction of Propylene is distilled out. Also the bottom stream with a mole fraction of 0.5039 Propylene and 0.4960 Propane is recycled back to the Reboiled Absorber. Thus Propylene is separated from the feed mixture and 99% product purity is obtained.

		<Title>Cooling of Benzene and Heating of Methane by Circulation of water</Title>
		<Description>Flowsheet Description:
Benzene and Methane which are cooled and heated are sent into the heater and cooler.
Water which is medium to exchange heat from benzene and methane is sent to the heater and increases its temperature by taking heat from the Benzene and enters in the Mixer and then in the separator which separates vapour/liquid water into saturated vapour and liquid.
Saturated vapour enters into the cooler and turns into saturated liquid and recycled to the mixer.
Saturated liquid from the separator is also recycled in to the mixer.
Heat released in the mixer is used to increase the temperature of the Methane.

		<Title>Vinyl Chloride Production</Title>
		<Description>Introduction
Vinyl chloride is an organochloride with the formula H2C=CHCl that is also called vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) or chloroethene. This colorless compound is an important industrial chemical chiefly used to produce the polymer polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
		Process Description:
Vinyl chloride is produced in a two step process from ethylene.
• Ethylene first reacts with Chlorine to produce Ethylene dichloride.
• The purified Ethylene dichloride undergoes selective cracking to form vinyl chloride.
Direct chlorination
EDC (ethylene dichloride) is prepared by reacting ethylene and chlorine In the presence of iron(III) chloride as a catalyst, these compounds react exothermically:
CH2=CH2 + Cl2 → ClCH2CH2Cl
This process results in high purity EDC and high yields. Dissolved catalyst and moisture must be removed before EDC enters the vinyl chloride production process
• C2H4 and Cl2 are mixed and sent to the Direct Chlorination reactor.
• The conversion in the Direct Chlorination Reactor is assumed to be 100%, while that in pyrolysis reactor is only 60%.
• Further both the columns are assumed to carry out perfect separations, with overhead and bottoms temperatures computed based on dew- and bubble-point temperatures, respectively.
• The products from the pyrolysis furnace are cooled and sent to HCL column where HCL is removed as overhead product and the bottoms, which include Vinyl Chloride and 1,2-dichloroethane are sent to the second distillation column.
• The vapour product from the VC column is Vinyl Chloride and the bottoms are 1,2-dichloroethane and is sent for recycle to increase the production.

		<Title>Design and Control of Distillation Processes for Methanol – Chloroform</Title>
		<Description>Methanol is the simplest alcohol, being only a methyl group linked to a hydroxyl group. It is a
light, volatile, colorless, flammable liquid with a distinctive odor very similar to that of ethanol
(drinking alcohol). However, unlike ethanol, methanol is highly toxic and unfit for consumption.
At room temperature, it is a polar liquid. It is used as an antifreeze, solvent, fuel, and as a
denaturant for ethanol. It is also used for producing biodiesel by transesterification reaction.
Methanol is used primarily as a feedstock for the manufacture of chemicals, and as a fuel for
specialized vehicles. Chloroform, or trichloromethane, is an organic compound with formula
CHCl3. It is a colorless, sweet-smelling, dense liquid that is produced on a large scale as a
precursor to PTFE. It is also a precursor to various refrigerants. In terms of scale, the most
important reaction of chloroform is with hydrogen fluoride to give monochlorodifluoromethane
(CFC-22), a precursor in the production of polytetrafluoroethylene. It is also used as an
anesthetic, solvent and a reagent in several other chemical processes. The binary mixture of
methanol–chloroform exhibits a minimum-boiling azeotrope with ∼34 mol% methanol at 327 K
under atmospheric pressure. Therefore, we need to carry out Extractive Distillation to separate
both methanol and chloroform. However, now a day’s a new method known as Pressure Swing
Distillation has come into picture and can be used. It is also found to be more economical than
the Extractive Distillation method as no extra solvent is required to achieve the separation.
Therefore, in this work Pressure Swing Distillation for the separation of Methanol and
Chloroform has been carried out.
Process Description:
In this process first the feed stream containing 0.5 mole fraction Methanol and 0.5 mole fraction
Chloroform is sent to a distillation column which has 24 stages. The feed is send to stage
number 9 whereas the recycled feed is sent to stage number 18. The flow rate of the feed is
around 100 kmol/hr., 300K and the recycle ratio of the tower is 0.55. The first distillation column
produces bottom with 0.995 mole fraction methanol. The distillates of the first column are sent to
a second distillation column. The second distillation column has a reflux ratio of 0.95 and it
produces distillates which are recycled back to the first distillation column and the bottom
product has a composition of 0.995 mole fraction Chloroform. The first distillation column is a
low pressure distillation column maintained at a pressure of 1 atm whereas the second
distillation column is a high pressure distillation column maintained at a pressure of 10 atm.

		<Title>Hydroalkylation of Toluene to Benzene Using Hydrogen</Title>
		<Description>Hydroalkylation is a chemical reaction that often involves reacting an aromatic hydrocarbon, such as toluene in the presence of hydrogen gas to form a simple aromatic hydrocarbon devoid of functional groups. This chemical process usually occurs at high temperature, at high pressure, or in the presence of a catalyst.
Hydroalkylation of toluene is synergized by poly-isopropyl benzene which is obtained in the process of manufacture of cumene as distillate. The process is to obtain benzene from dealkylation in the presence of H2. In the process, the pure benzene of 96.43% is obtained while about 96.7% of Toluene is recycled back to the feed stream. Various hydroalkylation processes can be used, in which hydrogen and alkyl aromatic hydrocarbons are contacted in a reaction zone at high temperature.
Key words: Hydroalkylation-Toluene-Benzene-DWISM-Simulation
PROCESS DESCRIPTION
The property package used for the complete flow Diagram is SRK Model.
Hydrogen and Toluene are fed in their respective feed streams and are mixed in the mixer (MIX-012) and the mixture feed is obtained from the material stream (MSTR-010). The mixture product passes through the heater (HEAT-004) where calculations are based on outlet of 873.15K and efficiency is 100%.
The hot mixture from heater is fed to the conversion reactor RC-007. In the reactor, Toluene is reacted with hydrogen to produce Benzene and Methane.
Toluene + HydrogenBenzene + Methane
Reactor operates at 600-650˚C and 35-40 atms, product stream from the reactor is passed through a cooler (COOL-011) of outlet temperature of 353.15K with efficiency of 100%. The products are then separated in the separator vessel where vapour stream and light liquid streams are separated to MSTR-016 and MSTR-015 respectively. The vapour is recycled back to the mixture while the light liquid stream is passed through the heater HEAT-019, with the outlet temperature of 375.15. The product is then fed to the distillation column (DC-028).
From the distillation column, Pure Benzene is obtained as a distillate while Toluene is recycled back to Toluene mixture. The Toluene recycled and Toluene fed are pumped to the mixture MIX012.
