  "description": "Production of Natural Gas\n\nIntroduction\nThis aim of this project was to convert existing literature into a steady state simulation of Syngas production using\nliquefied natural gas (R-LNG) as a raw material. The simulation uses the provided data of mass flow rates,\ntemperature and pressure obtained from Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore Ltd (FACT), ammonia plant.\nThe novelty of using R-LNG is that it has a lower carbon/hydrogen ratio, resulting in a total reduction of\nsteam: carbon ratio and subsequently reduces CO2 emissions and thus reduces the carbon footprint of the process.\nAmmonia is produced from a gaseous mixture comprising of mainly N2 and H2 in a 1:3 ratio. Conventionally ammonia plants\nuse naphtha as a feedstock for syngas production serving as a source for H2 while the N2 is obtained from the air.\nUsing naphtha as a feed generates high amount of CO2 due to higher carbon to hydrogen ratio. FACT wishes to upgrade its\nplant by introducing syngas production using R-LNG. This paper provides a simulation for the same.\nProcess Description\nThe ammonia production mainly consists of two steps:\n(1) Syngas Production\n(2) Ammonia Synthesis\nPart I will only be focused in this flow sheet. The unit operations included are steam reforming (primary reforming),\nair reforming (secondary reforming), CO shift reaction, CO2 removal and finally methanation. In the primary reformer,\nhydrocarbon reforming takes place in the presence of steam. This reaction is controlled to maintain 10.5% of\nhydrocarbon in the output stream that is necessary to perform complete air reforming in secondary reformer.\nIn secondary reformer, the nitrogen for ammonia synthesis is produced by air reforming. Here heat is supplied\nby combustion. Burning gas provides heat for the rest of the reforming process.\nAfter the reforming section, the output stream contains H2, N2, CO, CO2 and along with minute presence of unreacted\nhydrocarbons. Removal of carbon oxides is carried out using shift convertors and CO2 absorber.\nIn the CO shift conversion, the CO acts as reducing agent for water to yield H2 and CO2. Methanation\nis the simplest procedure to remove traces of carbon oxides from a stream. So using the above mentioned method,\nthe concentration of carbon oxides is reduced.\nSyngas production or feed preparation for ammonia synthesis has been modeled using three conversion reactors and two\nequilibrium reactors. In this particular work, desulphurized R-LNG acts as a hydrogen source. When this R-LNG is\nreacted with steam, it gets reformed in a primary reformer which is a conversion reactor. Air is added to the second\nconversion reactor (secondary reformer) to obtain the nitrogen. Shift conversion reactions take place in next\ntwo equilibrium reactors. It is followed by CO2 absorption, for the removal of CO2 from the feed. Later a methanator unit,\nwhich is a conversion reactor, is used to remove traces of carbon oxides from the stream.\n\nReactions\nThe following reactions take place in their respective reactors:\nPrimary reforming\n(a) CH4 + H2O -> CO + 3H2 (Conversion reaction)\n(b) CH4 + 2H2O ->CO2 + 4H2 (Conversion reaction)\n(c) CO + H2O -> CO2 + H2 (Equilibrium)\nSecondary reforming\n(a) CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O (Conversion reaction)\n(b) CH4 + 1.5O2 -> CO + 2H2O (Conversion reaction)\nShift conversion\n(a) CO + H2O -> CO2 + H2 (Equilibrium reaction)\nMethanation\n(a) CO + 3H2 -> CH4 + H2O (Conversion reaction)\n(b) CO2 + 3H2 -> CH4 + 2H2O (Conversion reaction) ",
