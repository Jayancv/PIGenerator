The pipe and instrumentation design has one floating node: [NODE], causing an error in simulation.
Please consider connect it to a correct flows or components.
Please identify the cause of the floating node and rewrite the corrected complete code.
Pleace consider following error in calculating flow and provide full python code using previous code
[ERRORS]

NOTE : Final output should contain all the code with correction of previous code (Full code).
