The pipe and instrumentation design has one floating node: [NODE], causing an error in simulation.
Please consider connect it to a correct flows or components. Please access the details in the
DWSIM API documentation website: https://dwsim.org/api_help/html/G_DWSIM.htm 
Please identify the cause of the floating node and rewrite the corrected complete code.
Please consider following error in calculating flow and provide full python code using previous code
[ERRORS]

NOTE : Final output should contain all the code with correction of previous code (Full code).
Please make sure your Python code is compatible with DWSIM. Do not use any placeholder or dummy values. 
Do not add reactions to python code.
