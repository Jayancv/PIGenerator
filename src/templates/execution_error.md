I am encountering an error when running the DWSIM code. Below is the error message:
[ERROR]

Please help me identify the bug and write the complete corrected code. 
Please provide full code with correction of previous code. 
NOTE : Final output should contain all the code with correction of previous code (Full code). 
Please make sure your Python code is compatible with DWSIM. Do not use any placeholder or dummy values inside the
