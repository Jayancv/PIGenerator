I got a DWSIM code bellow and need to validate is it contains all the relevant component for given usecase. 
Use case : 
[USECASE]

Generated code: 
[CODE]

Please help me identify is there any missing components. If any component missing then rewrite a new code with all the components.
Otherwise, send output as 'Correct'

NOTE : Final output should contain all the code with correction of previous code(Full code).
