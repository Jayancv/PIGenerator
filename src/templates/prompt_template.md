[INPUT]

Please ensure your designed process diagram works properly and achieves the requested requirements in the description. 
Then provide a executable python script that generates the diagram with DWSIM.

Here is an example:


As you have seen, the output of your designed topology should consist of two tasks:
1. Give a detailed design plan about all devices and their interconnectivity nodes and properties.
2. Write a complete DWSIM Python code and run the calculation. 


Please make sure your Python code is compatible with DWSIM. 
Please give the runnable code without any placeholders based one some configs in above code.
