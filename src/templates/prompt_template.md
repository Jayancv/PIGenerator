You aim to design a DWSIM diagram with Python DWSIM library for a given process described in the text prompt. 
Task : 
[INPUT]

Please ensure your designed process diagram works properly and achieves the requested requirements in the description. 
Then provide an executable python script that generates the diagram with DWSIM. Please access the details in the
DWSIM API documentation website: https://dwsim.org/api_help/html/G_DWSIM.htm 

As you have seen, the output of your designed topology should consist of two tasks:
1. Give a detailed design plan about all devices and their interconnectivity nodes and properties.
2. Write a complete DWSIM Python code and run the calculation and simulation. 

Please make sure your Python code is compatible with DWSIM. Do not use any placeholder or dummy values in the Python 
code. Do not add reactions to python code. 
Please give the runnable code without any placeholders based one some configs in above code. 
Consider following context to build the solution
